There are 3 projects:
1) AlienCurrenciesSolver is the class library that actually does all the work
2) AlienCurrenciesSolverTests are just tests for that class library, using MSTest
3) AlienCurrencies is the client app. I have interfaced the View, and provided one implementation that loads
the data from a Data.txt file included in the project, and displays the output in console. I can provide others
if needed.

The Data.txt has the two given data sets, plus two more I made up.
